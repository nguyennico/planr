# planr <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" height="200" />

The goal of planr is to provide some functions for the activity of Demand & Supply Planning and S&OP process:

-   to calculate projected inventories and coverages

-   to calculate and analyze projected inventories and coverages

-   to calculate a Replenishment Plan (also called DRP : Distribution Requirement Planning)

## Installation

You can install the development version of planr through GitHub:

```r
library(devtools)
install_github("nguyennico/planr")

library(planr)
```

## Examples

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

Let's create a demo database:

```{r}
Period <- 
  c("1/1/2020", "2/1/2020", "3/1/2020", "4/1/2020", "5/1/2020", "6/1/2020", 
    "7/1/2020", "8/1/2020", "9/1/2020", "10/1/2020", "11/1/2020", "12/1/2020",
    "1/1/2021", "2/1/2021", "3/1/2021", "4/1/2021", "5/1/2021", "6/1/2021", 
    "7/1/2021", "8/1/2021", "9/1/2021", "10/1/2021", "11/1/2021", "12/1/2021")

Demand <- 
  c(360, 458, 300, 264, 140, 233, 229, 208, 260, 336, 295, 226, 336, 434, 276, 
    240, 116, 209, 205, 183, 235, 312, 270, 201)

Opening.Inventories <-
  c(1310, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)

Supply.Plan <- 
  c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2500, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)


# assemble
my_demand_and_supply <- data.frame(Period,
                                   Demand,
                                   Opening.Inventories,
                                   Supply.Plan)

# let's add a Product
my_demand_and_supply$DFU <- "Product A"

# format the Period as a date
my_demand_and_supply$Period <- 
  as.Date(as.character(my_demand_and_supply$Period), format = '%m/%d/%Y')

# let's have a look at it
my_demand_and_supply
```

It contains some basic features:

-   a Product: it's an item, a SKU (Storage Keeping Unit), or a SKU at a location, also called a DFU (Demand Forecast Unit)

-   a Period of time : for example monthly or weekly buckets

-   a Demand : could be some sales forecasts, expressed in units

-   an Opening Inventory : what we hold as available inventories at the beginning of the horizon, expressed in units

-   a Supply Plan : the supplies that we plan to receive, expressed in units

### Calculation of Projected Inventories & Coverages

Let's apply the `light_proj_inv()` function. 

We are going to calculate 2 new features for each DFU:

-   projected inventories

-   projected coverages, based on the Demand Forecasts

```{r}
# calculate
library(planr)

calculated_projection <-
  light_proj_inv(
    dataset = my_demand_and_supply,
    DFU = DFU,
    Period = Period,
    Demand =  Demand,
    Opening.Inventories = Opening.Inventories,
    Supply.Plan = Supply.Plan
  )

# see results
calculated_projection
```
