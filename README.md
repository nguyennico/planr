The goal of planr is to provide some functions for the activity of
Demand & Supply Planning and S&OP process:

- to calculate projected inventories and coverages :
  **light_proj_inv()**

- to calculate and analyze projected inventories and coverages :
  **proj_inv()**

- to calculate a Replenishment Plan (also called DRP : Distribution
  Requirement Planning) : **drp()**
